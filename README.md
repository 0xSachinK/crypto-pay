## Aadhar on-chain using Polygon ID

https://devfolio.co/projects/aadhaareth-a4fa

### Problem

Identity has been a major problem in Blockchain systems, and so for mass adoption, a new easier Identity verification process has to be created with privacy in mind. So we created a platform where we can verify users' Aadhaar IDs & give them claims using PolygonID all in a privacy-preserving manner.

Along the way, we realized so much potential with this Aadhaar verification that now anyone can send someone crypto using that person's Phone Number (on-chain, no Phone No info is being revealed in this process) or add 2FA to the wallet for safety.
